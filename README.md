<h1>Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) Trends Analysis</h1>

<p>This repository contains an extensive research project examining the progress towards achieving the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). It analyzes the linearity and polynomial nature of trends related to various SDGs.</p>

<h2>Project Overview</h2>

<p>The study scrutinizes four primary areas:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Trends of electricity access</li>
  <li>Equal representation of women and men in parliaments</li>
  <li>Universal internet access</li>
  <li>Food sufficiency for everyone</li>
</ul>

<p>The research offers a comprehensive evaluation of linear and polynomial trends and employs the Method of Least Squares for curve fitting. The project aims to provide credible predictions and suggest effective strategies to accelerate the attainment of these SDGs.</p>

<h2>Key Findings</h2>

<p>The study yields insights into the anticipated year of achieving certain SDGs based on linear and polynomial trend analysis. It also highlights the limitations of both methods and the circumstances where one may be preferred over the other.</p>

<h2>Dataset</h2>

<p>The dataset used for this study spans from 2001 to 2018 and includes 12 sustainable development indicators tracked by UNICEF.</p>

<h2>Methodology</h2>

<p>The research primarily involves trend analysis, prediction modeling, and comparative analysis. It utilizes statistical techniques to determine the best fit for the data, aiming to offer the most accurate forecast of when global and country-specific goals will be met.</p>

<h2>Contribution</h2>

<p>Findings from this study could influence national policies, aid program development, and guide private sector decision-making towards more sustainable business practices. This research supports international efforts to reduce carbon emissions and promote a more sustainable future.</p>
